    <h4> ... are a way to define the size of the universe </h4>
    <h4> They are measured in powers of ten, and range from </h4>
    <h4> 10^-35 to 10^26. When you get to 10^0, you are at </h4>
    <h4> exactly one meter. Every step you go 10 times higher </h4>
    <h4> or 10 times lower. We start at the smallest thing possible... </h4>
        <h2> 10^-35 </h2>
        <h4> Planck's constant </h4>
        <p> Planck's Constant is the smallest any possible thing in the <br>
            universe can be. It is 100 quintillion times smaller than one meter. <br>
            That's 1/100,000,000,000,000,000,000th of a meter! </p>
        <h2> 10^-24 </h2>
        <h4> 1 septillionth of a meter! </h4>
        <h4> The size of an electron! </h4>
        <p> Electrons are tiny particles that orbit the nucleus of an atom <br>
            in a sort of "probability cloud". (Quantum physics are really weird) </p>
        <h2> 10^-21 - 10^-18 </h2>
        <h4> 1 sextillionth - 1 quintillionth of a meter </h4>
        <h4> The size of quarks </h4> 
        <p> Quarks build protons and neutrons, which are part of atomic nuclei <br>
            They create the fundamental building blocks for all matter. There are <br>
            6 types of quarks: Up, Down, Top, Bottom, Strange, and Charm. </p>
        <h2> 10^-15 </h2>
        <h4> 1 quadrillionth of a meter </h4>
        <h4> The size of a single proton </h4>
        <p> Protons are made of quarks, and are one of 2 parts of atomic <br>
            nuclei. They are the building blocks of the building blocks <br>
            of the universe. </p>
        <h2> 10^-14 </h2>
        <h4> Ten quadrillionths of a meter </h4>
        <h4> The size of an atomic nucleus </h4>
        <p> The nucleus is the center of an atom, it is made of protons and <br>
            neutrons. The biggest atom has 118 protons in the nucleus. </p>
        <h2> 10^-13 </h2>
        <h4> 100 quadrillionths of a meter </h4>
        <h4> Atomic emptiness </h4>
        <p> Atomic emptiness is the space between the electron orbitals <br>
            and the nucleus of atoms. Some very heavy man-made atoms <br>
            fall into this size range </p>
        <h2> 10^-12 </h2>
        <h4> 1 trillionth of a meter </h4>
        <h4> Minerals in Neutron Stars </h4>
        <p> Extremely heavily compressed atoms and their electron orbitals <br>
            fit into this size range. One teaspoon of neutron star matter <br>
            weighs 4 billion tons (8,000,000,000,000 pounds) </p>
        <h2> 10^-11 </h2> 
        <h4> 10 trillionths of a meter </h4>
        <h4> Interior orbitals of a carbon atom </h4>
        <p> The inside orbitals of a normal carbon atom. Carbon <br>
            is essential for all water based life on Earth! </p>
        <h2> 10^-10 </h2>
        <h4> 100 trillionths of a meter </h4>
        <h4> Water molecule </h4>
        <p> I'm not gonna explain what water is. Come on. <br>
            You know what water is. </p>
        <h2> 10^-9 </h2>
        <h4> One billionth of a meter </h4>
        <h4> Complex molecules </h4>
        <p> Most complex molecules will fall into this size range <br>
            Hemoglobin, which is in our red blood cells, falls <br>
            into this category </p>
        <h2> 10^-8 </h2>
        <h4> 10 billionths of a meter </h4>
        <h4> Width of chromosomes </h4>
        <p> Chromosomes help make there is enough DNA during cell <br>
            divisions and they help to determine your gender at birth. </p>
        <h2> 10^-7 </h2>
        <h4> 100 billionths of a meter </h4>
        <h4> Viruses </h4>
        <p> Virus forms are usually around this size. One notable virus <br>
            is called COVID-19, you may not have heard of it. <br>
            (that sentence was dripping with sarcasm) </p>
        <h2> 10^-6 </h2>
        <h4> 1 millionth of a meter (One micrometer) </h4>
        <h4> Large bacteria </h4>
        <p> Some large bacteria are around this size (one micrometer) <br>
            You probably know what bacteria are. </p>
        <h2> 10^-5 </h2>
        <h4> 10 micrometers </h4>
        <h4> Most animal cells </h4>
        <p> The cells of most animals will fit into this size range <br>
            Mushroom spores and cactus pollen would as well. </p>
        <h2> 10^-4 </h2>
        <h4> 0.1 millimeters </h4>
        <h4> Plant cells/pollen </h4>
        <p> Most plant cells come in this size range becuase of their thick <br>
        cell walls. Plant pollens come in at this range too. </p>
        <h2> 10^-3 </h2>
        <h4> 1 millimeter </h4>
        <h4> The size of a snowflake </h4>
        <p> Most dendritic snowflakes (The ones with cool patterns) <br> 
            are in this size range. This is where you can begin to see <br>
            things well with your eyes. </p>
        <h2> 10^-2 </h2>
        <h4> 1 centimeter </h4>
        <h4> The size of a lego brick </h4>
        <p> 1x1 or 1x2 lego bricks are the closest to being this size, <br>
            but most legos do fall into this range. </p>
        <h2> 10^-1 </h2>
        <h4> 1 decimeter (10 centimeters) </h4>
        <h4> The size of a baseball </h4>
        <p> An apple, a pear, a baseball, and things around that size <br>
            are close to one decimeter in size. 
        <h2> 10^0 </h2>
        <h4> 1 meter </h4>
        <h4> The size of a small child </h4>
        <p> One meter. The building block of every order of magnitude, <br>
            from the biggest to the smallest. 
        <h4> And now, we have come from the smallest possible thing </h4>
        <h4> to the buidling block of every order of magnitude </h4>
        <h3> But wait, there's more! For 2.99 a month... </h3>
        <h4> Nah, I'm just kidding. </h4>
        <h4> There are still 26 orders of magnitude to go! </h4>
